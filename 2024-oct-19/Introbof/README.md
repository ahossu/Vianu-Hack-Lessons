This is a introductory BOF challenge. ðŸ‘€ 

During the lesson, a server's public IP & port will be given, on which this program (`main.c`) runs. 

You may connect to it using the `nc [ip] [port]` command and exploit this on the server. You can also test this on your own computer, but you won't be able to access the flag (as it is stored on the server).

Exploit the program on the server and get the flag!

Side quest: if you're experienced in this type of vulnerabilities (and you easily found the main flag), you should try to gain RCE on the remote server, as there is another vulnerability involved.
